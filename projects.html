            <p>As an intern at Harvard, I got to work alongside the researchers at the Visual Computing Group (VCG) on
                some of the most prospective research in neuroscience. The group, as part of the collaboration with
                Harvard's Centre for Brain Science, are part of the overarching effort towards completely mapping the
                brain's "connectome" - the complete connectivity diagram of the neuronal circuits within the brain. If
                successful, their work could transform much of neuroscience and could lead to bio-inspired solutions to
                alleviate issues with the current machine learning algorithms <a
                        class="link link--dark"
                        href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609070/inside-the-moonshot-effort-to-finally-figure-out-the-brain/"
                        target="_blank">[link]</a>. It is also the essential step towards even attempting to
                reverse-engineer the brain.
            </p>
            <p>The task is highly non-trivial. The cerebral cortex of the human brain contains more than 160 trillion
                synapses, and each neuron receives synaptic inputs from hundreds, or even thousands of different
                neurons, spread out over a large distance. Deciphering the connectome of even one type of neuron in the
                cortex poses enormous challenges.
            </p>

                cortex.
            </div>

            <p>For the past few years, the laboratory has been cutting and imaging the brain on nanometre scale with
                multi-beam electron microscopy, and developing systems for 3d reconstruction and segmentation of the
                image into individual neurons and synapses. The next step of the process is to create tools to study
                this data in order to determine what makes the brain process information the way it does.
            </p>

            <p>Throughout my time with the group, I worked on graph analysis tools for connectomics, including
                investigation of the methods for graph matching, graph kernels, graph edit distance estimation with
                graph neural networks, and motif discovery; I was primarily focusing on finding ways to improve upon one
                of the current de-facto methods for biological network analysis: <a class="link link--dark"
                                                                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif"
                                                                                    target="_blank">network motif
                    discovery</a>. Network motifs can be thought of as recurrent patterns of connections within a
                network such as that of synapses within the brain. They are particularly interesting within the context
                of connectomics, because brain motifs can often perform certain "computational" functions; for instance,
                the two motifs shown below are examples of a max() operator and a regulator().</p>

            <div class="projects_img" style="margin-bottom: -20px;"><img src="images/brain-motifs.png"></div>

            <p>Brain Networks are particularly challenging for motif discovery analysis. For one, they are extremely
                large; Even just a cube of a rodent cortex with the size 1x1x1 mm already contains roughly 100,000
                neurons, and 100,000,000 synapses. Furthermore, a motif discovery algorithm usually overlooks any
                information other than what other neurons each of the neurons is connected to. In reality, there is a
                wide range of additional parameters that determine the function a neuron performs within the neuronal
                circuit that we would like to take into account; for instance, a neuron can be excitatory or inhibitory,
                or its axons could be myelinated resulting in much stronger signals being transmitted.
            </p>
            <p>To alleviate these issues, we had to look for an exploratory method that finds frequent patterns within
                the network while allowing for a small variation within them, and that can easily take additional
                parameters into account. Allowing for small deviations would make the method significantly more robust
                for larger motifs, and more adaptable to networks with multiple edges and edge parameters such as the
                brain network. One of the key aspects of arriving at such a solution are methods for graph comparison;
                in particular, how to efficiently evaluate whether two patterns are similar.</p>

            <p>Due to recent developments in neural networks that operate on graphs such as <a class="link link--dark"
                                                                                               href="http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/"
                                                                                               target="_blank">GraphSAGE</a>
                or <a class="link link--dark"
                      href="https://mila.quebec/en/publication/graph-attention-networks/"
                      target="_blank">Graph Attention Networks</a>, I investigated
                whether these models could be applied for sub-graph or pattern similarity estimation. These methods have
                seen high success in for instance social network analysis scenariosÂ [link], but needed to be heavily
                adapted to this fundamentally different task. The key advantage of using a function approximator such as
                a neural network is that in principle, it should be able to learn any graph similarity (Graph Edit
                Distance) function, while being significantly more computationally efficient. Possibly the largest
                challenge was making sure the neural network inhibits the node permutation invariance features that a
                graph data structure inherently contains.

            <p>As a team of 4 Cambridge undergraduates, we have founded the CU Machine Intelligence Network. Our aim is
                to become a space for Cambridge students to collaborate with companies and each other on machine
                learning projects,
                provide the tools necessary to do so, run workshops for those who are just getting started, and invite
                interesting speakers from the industry and the academia. As of now, there is no other society that
                allows undergraduates to pursue their machine learning interest collectively, and we are hoping our
                student
                society will contribute to greater activity in that area within the university.</p>
